ARTK is a Reverse Engineering Tool Kit 
I have developed a script which helps the lazy people on reverse engineering android apps.

The script was written using Bash Language and it depends on the following tools:

- APKTool
- Dex2Jar

And you will be able to download the following tools using the script if itâ€™s not available in your device
